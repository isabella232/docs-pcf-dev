Pivotal provides experimental support for deploying <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev to AWS for Pivotal employees. For more information, contact Pivotal on Slack.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev is not a secure distribution of <%= vars.platform_name %>. If you deploy <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev to AWS, you must manage access to <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev within AWS.</p>

To use <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev with AWS, you must have Vagrant and the Vagrant AWS Provider plugin installed. For more information, see the [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) website and the [Vagrant AWS Provider](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws) repository on GitHub.
