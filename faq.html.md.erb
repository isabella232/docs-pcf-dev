This topic provides guidance for common questions about configuring <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev.


## <a id="ssl_cert"></a> Why do I receive a "Invalid SSL Cert" error?

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf api api.dev.cfdev.sh
Setting api endpoint to api.dev.cfdev.sh...
FAILED
Invalid SSL Cert for api.dev.cfdev.sh
TIP: Use 'cf api --skip-ssl-validation' to continue with an insecure API endpoint
</pre>

<%= vars.platform_name %> Dev comes with a self-signed SSL certificate for its API. The self-signed SSL certificate causes an `Invalid SSL Cert` error when using the cf CLI. To avoid the error, use the `--skip-ssl-validation` option.


## <a id="host"></a> How can I connect apps running in <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev to services running on my workstation?

<%= vars.platform_name %> Dev provides a special hostname for addressing the host from inside of app containers. If the <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev system domain is `dev.cfdev.sh`, then the host is routable at `host.cfdev.sh`. Services running on the host must be listening on all network interfaces for apps to access them, not just `localhost`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Using <code>localhost</code> inside of app containers does not refer to your workstation.</p>


## <a id="memory"></a> How can I customize the memory and CPU count used by <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev?

By default, <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev allocates 8&nbsp;GB of memory to run.

To change the allocated memory, run:

```
cf dev start -m NEW-ALLOCATED-MEMORY
```

Where `NEW-ALLOCATED-MEMORY` is the amount of memory you want to allocate in MB.

By default, <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev tries to use 4 cores. To change this setting, run:

```
cf dev start -c DESIRED-NUMBER-OF-CORES
```

Where `DESIRED-NUMBER-OF-CORES` is the number of processor cores <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev should use.


## <a id="security_groups"></a> How are App Security Groups (ASGs) configured in <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev?

Unlike <%= vars.platform_name %>, <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev allows applications to access all private address ranges without the need for additional ASGs. This is because <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev is considered a trusted, local environment. You can remove the `all_pcfdev` security group by running:

```
cf unbind-running-security-group all_pcfdev
```

Changes do not apply to existing running apps until they are restarted.
