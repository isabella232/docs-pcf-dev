This guide describes how to install and use PCF Dev, a fully featured Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) installation that runs on your workstation's native hypervisor.

PCF Dev enables application developers to test and debug their app on a local PCF deployment, and enables operators to test out features of PCF in their local environment.

PCF Dev includes Pivotal Application Service (PAS), Spring Cloud Services, Redis, RabbitMQ, and MySQL. It also supports all Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) functionality. See the [Comparing PCF Dev to Pivotal Cloud Foundry](#comparison-to-pcf) table below for more product details.
