This topic describes how to install <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev on Linux.


## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

### <a id='qemu-libvirt'></a> QEMU + libvirt

<%= vars.platform_name %> Dev uses [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) and [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) for virtualization. 

To install on Ubuntu systems, run:

```
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-bin libvirt-doc
```

### <a id="cf-cli"></a> Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface

<%= vars.platform_name %> Dev uses the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) (cf CLI) to push and scale apps.

1. Download the cf CLI for your Linux distribution from the [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads) repository on GitHub. If you previously used the cf CLI v5 Ruby gem, uninstall this gem first.

1. Install the downloaded package using the package manager for your distribution.

1. To verify your installation, open a terminal window and enter `cf` at the prompt. If your installation was successful, the cf CLI help listing appears.

1. Download the latest version of <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).

	```
	cf install-plugin cfdev
	```
