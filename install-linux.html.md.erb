This topic describes how to install PCF Dev on Linux.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

### QEMU + libvirt
PCF Dev uses [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) and [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) for virtualization. 

To install on Ubuntu systems, run `sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-bin libvirt-doc` in a terminal window.

### <a id="cf-cli"></a>Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface

PCF Dev uses the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) (cf CLI) to push and scale apps.

1. Download the cf CLI for your Linux distribution from the [cf CLI repository in GitHub](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads). If you previously used the cf CLI v5 Ruby gem, uninstall this gem first.

1. Install the downloaded package using the package manager for your distribution.

1. To verify your installation, open a terminal window and enter `cf` at the prompt. If your installation was successful, the cf CLI help listing appears.
