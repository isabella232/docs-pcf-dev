This topic describes how to install PCF Dev on Windows 10.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

### <a id="virtualbox"></a>Hyper-V

PCF Dev uses Hyper-V on Windows 10 to run on native hypervisors.

To enable Hyper-V on your machine before starting PCF Dev, follow the steps in [Install Hyper-V on Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v) in the Microsoft documentation

### <a id="cf-cli"></a>Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface

PCF Dev uses the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) (cf CLI) to push and scale apps.

1. [Download](https://cli.run.pivotal.io/stable?release=windows64&source=github-rel) the cf CLI for Windows (64 bit). If you previously used the cf CLI v5 Ruby gem, you must uninstall the gem first.

1. Unpack the zip file and open the `cf_installer` application.

1. Follow the installer wizard to install.

1. To verify your installation, open a terminal window and enter `cf`. If your installation was successful, the cf CLI help listing appears.
