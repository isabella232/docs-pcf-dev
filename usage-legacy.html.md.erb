<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This topic applies only to <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev v0.30 or earlier. If you are using a later version of <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev, see <a href="usage.html">Using <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev</a>.</p>

This topic describes how to use <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev to target instances, push an application, and list available marketplace services.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To use your <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev instance, you must be running the <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev VM. In a terminal window, run <code>cf dev start</code> to boot the VM.</p>


## <a id="pcf-dev"></a> Log In to Your <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev Instance

After launching your <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev instance, use the `cf login` command with the `-a` flag to target its API:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf login -a https<span>:</span>//api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation
Email: user
Password: pass
</pre>

The terminal displays your API system domain when you run `cf dev start`. In most cases, your API system domain is `api.local.pcfdev.io`, but it may differ slightly depending on your host system configuration.


## <a id="push"></a> Push an App

Follow the procedure below to push an app to your <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev instance.

1. Navigate to your app directory.

1. Run `cf push APP-NAME`. Replace `APP-NAME` with a name of your choice.

For more information about pushing apps to your deployment, see the [Pushing an App](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html) topic.

For more information about using the cf CLI, see the [Getting Started with the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/getting-started.html) topic.


## <a id="marketplace"></a> List Marketplace Services

<%= vars.platform_name %> Dev supports marketplace services, giving developers access to Redis, RabbitMQ, and MySQL.

In order to view the list of available services, run `cf marketplace` in a terminal window.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org pcfdev-org / space pcfdev-space as admin...
OK

service      plans        description
p-mysql      512mb, 1gb   MySQL databases on demand
p-rabbitmq   standard     RabbitMQ is a robust and scalable high-performance multi-protocol messaging broker.
p-redis      shared-vm    Redis service to provide a key-value store
</pre>

For more information about using marketplace services, see the [Using Services in <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev](dev-services.html) topic.


## <a id="apps-manager"></a> Use Apps Manager

When you start <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev, Apps Manager starts automatically. Follow the procedure below to access Apps Manager.

1. Navigate to `https://apps.local.pcfdev.io/`
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev started on a domain other than <code>local.pcfdev.io</code>, then the Apps Manager URL is different. For example, if you log in to <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev at <code>api.local3.pcfdev.io</code>, then navigate to <a href="https://apps.local3.pcfdev.io/">https://apps.local3.pcfdev.io/</a> to access Apps Manager.</p>

1. The first time you open Apps Manager after starting the <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev, your browser shows a dialog or page about the security certificate. Choose to connect to the Apps Manager URL. Alternatively, you can run `cf dev trust` to add the <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev certificate to your OS certificate store. See [here](./configuring.html#trust) for more details.

1. Log in using admin/admin or user/pass. The Pivotal <%= vars.platform_name %> Dev page appears:
